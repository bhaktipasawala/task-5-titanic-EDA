Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
# Titanic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Objective
The goal of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset and find patterns, trends, and insights through visual and statistical analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Dataset: Titanic Dataset (or any relevant dataset
- 
## What I Did
1. Data Exploration:
   - Used .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to understand the dataset.
2. Visualizations:
   - Created :Histograms, Boxplots, Pairplots,  Heatmaps,Pie Charts and, Violin Plots to explore the data.
   
3. Analysis:
   - Looked for patterns in survival rates based on features like age, class, and gender.
   - Checked for correlations between variables.
  
## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook: Contains all the code and visualizations.
